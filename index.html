and Cristina Calnegru.My main areas of interest are generative modeling, language grounding and reinforcement learning.
Before my Master, I completed my B.Sc. in Electro-Mechanical Engineering at "Tecnologico de Monterrey" (Mexico), and worked for
4 years in different energy industries and 1 year as an Entrepreneur.
</p>

<p>At the moment, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Clyde & Co, an International Law Firm, focused on natural language processing tasks
    such as Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction, as well as Memory augmented neural networks, and Stochastic Processes.
